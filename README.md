**Solution Architecture in Auckland:**

> We did solution options discussions once in the past year, and the end results weren't even transparent to us.  
-- Aashiq Durga

**Research with Auckland Associates:**

_Hypothetically speaking, do you think your crew rotation experience would've been better if you had the chance to go to Melbourne and would you have been able to share different perspectives with your current team if you had?_

> Definitely - there are a limited number of teams you can join here in Auckland.  
I know in Melbourne they have different tech stacks that they prefer. While I know that technologies shouldn’t be what you chase, but working with different technologies can give you a different experience when solving problems. Each language/technology has ways of doing things that are unique to them.  
There are also teams in Melbourne which don’t deal with just MYOB products - eg. Don’t Panic, Replicant. Getting experience from a team which focuses on helping streamline and support the rest of the company will give quite a different experience to working on a product team. Being able to cross-pollinate between product teams and those sorts of teams would be helpful to MYOB.

2. What crew are you looking to rotate into and what skills will you obtain from that rotation?

**Testimony from Ryan about Growth while being in Replicant**

> JC puts you on the spot about drawing diagrams about the architecture with the operations, but because of this and along side the learning milestones I was able to go from drawing only 3 boxes to 20-30 boxes. -- Ryan

4. What value will you bring to Melbourne in that rotation?

**Testimony from Shailan about IT Challenge:**

> Saish was a great asset to us during the organisation of the MYOB IT Challenge 2018, in particular with writing the case challenge, presenting at the launch event and also being a judge for the Auckland and Wellington Regional Finals. He would add tremendous value to go to Melbourne team, not only as a result of the help he provided in organising the MYOB IT Challenge but also the other attributes he has developed in his time at MYOB so far. -- Shailan Patel

**Testimony from Auckland Interns about Timelines:**

> It was really helpful for mapping out the direction I wanted to go in with my learning for the internship, and it was definitely nice to be able to look back on it and see how I was doing in relation to the goals that I had set at the beginning. -- Vilia Li

> The roadmap is definitely a good idea for keeping track of the goals of the internship. Around about a week after I had my goal conversation/meeting with my mentors I had honestly forgotten most of what I had said.  A roadmap would have been perfect to keep myself on track to ensure I was doing my best to properly fulfill my goals for the internship. -- Sean Spires
