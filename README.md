Solution Architecture in Auckland:

> We did solution options discussions once in the past year, and the end results weren't even transparent to us.  
-- Aashiq Durga

Research with Auckland Associates: 

_Hypothetically speaking, do you think your crew rotation experience would've been better if you had the chance to go to Melbourne and would you have been able to share different perspectives with your current team if you had?_

> Definitely - there are a limited number of teams you can join here in Auckland.  
I know in Melbourne they have different tech stacks that they prefer. While I know that technologies shouldn’t be what you chase, but working with different technologies can give you a different experience when solving problems. Each language/technology has ways of doing things that are unique to them.  
There are also teams in Melbourne which don’t deal with just MYOB products - eg. Don’t Panic, Replicant. Getting experience from a team which focuses on helping streamline and support the rest of the company will give quite a different experience to working on a product team. Being able to cross-pollinate between product teams and those sorts of teams would be helpful to MYOB.

4. What value will you bring to Melbourne in that rotation?

Testimony from Shailan:

> Saish was a great asset to us during the organisation of the MYOB IT Challenge 2018, in particular with writing the case challenge, presenting at the launch event and also being a judge for the Auckland and Wellington Regional Finals. He would add tremendous value to go to Melbourne team, not only as a result of the help he provided in organising the MYOB IT Challenge but also the other attributes he has developed in his time at MYOB so far. -- Shailan Patel
