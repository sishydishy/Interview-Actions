Questions:

1. Tell us why you would like to pursue a rotation in Melbourne?

During my journey at MYOB I've noticed that we are all about developing great software and creating growth mindsets so that we can always keep on developing. But we don't really look into hosting and maintaining our products.


This is where I want to develop my knowledge at my current point of time. I've always had a passion in the dev ops space, since our acceleration period whether that be helping the other proteges to get up their CI/CD tools or even getting the Hyperion ECS into a zero-downtime deployment. 

But I've noticed in Auckland there are a limited number of teams to join and although we have many great developers in Auckland, 

many of them cannot help me develop my passion and desire for the dev ops space. This is where I believe the Replicant team can really help enhance my abilities. 

I've seen the way they work and engage across MYOB and I know the job they are doing is a huge challenge, and I want to be there and experiencing it and growing from it.

Through this experience, I would be able to see a different perspective because instead of delivering software to our clients I would be with a team that focuses on supporting the rest of the company, which would give a varying experience from a product team. 

This aspect of cross-pollination can help make our crews great and thus be awesome. I've noticed in FMA we as proteges have the ability to pick up the best concepts from each rotation and carry it through into the following ones. 

This allows us to continuously improve and share our knowledge with our fellow peers. 

From my conversations with the Tony, Ryan, Morgan and JC I've noticed that they all mentioned that Melbourne has a certain rigor as far as practices go, but with this comes pros and cons, such as…

	- Pairing: There is a higher stigma in Richmond around Pairing and with this personally I believe creates an amazing learning environment, where developers can challenge each others opinions and also share their knowledge, thus reducing the key-man dependency that we see in a lot of organizations.

	- Solution Architecture: In Richmond and in Sydney, solution options are widely practiced but with constraints. These constraints are that the processes must be followed and that all architectural and technological choices be transparent. Afterwards, these choices have to be certified.
	Ref: If you flick to the github link provided, I have a testimony from one of mentors about processes of solution options in Auckland.
	
I believe that if I got the chance to go to Melbourne I would not only be able be part of an amazing learning environment but also have the chance to come back to Auckland and master my skills that I would've attained during my rotation.

Lastly, I had an amazing conversation with one of the Associate Developers in Auckland about if they had the chance to go to melb how that would've added to the rotation experience.

2. What crew are you looking to rotate into and what skills will you obtain from that rotation?

If you haven't guessed yet the team I would like to rotate into is Replicant. 

I have seen the groundwork put in by this crew and honestly it baffles me every time I see how much this crew has progressed over the last year. 

There is no silver bullet to mastering a broad range of skills but I believe in understanding the core fundamentals. And that’s where I feel Replicant's mentoring system will help me.

But before I continue I want explain why Replicant?

	- The first reason is their dev lead JC, not only has he helped his crew jump over each hurdle coming at them but he has managed to win the hearts of many people at MYOB. And I think its because he's a big believer in judging the culture and values of a system by the artifact it produces. I only met JC during my induction at MYOB but since then I've always gone to him when I've faced some really tough conversations, so overall he's been one of the leading factors for me to join Replicant.

	- Secondly, the environment. I've noticed that an environment can play a big role in your rotation. And the tools and skills obtain within these environments are just the cherry on top of the cake. 
	- E.g. grasping vim in first rotation.
	
	From my discussions with Ryan, I've noticed that Replicant not only builds a great platform but they also found themselves upon pairing and mentoring. 
		○ The replicant crew strictly have a max of 1-3 tickets in the dev column at once, which promotes pairing within the team of 5. From what I've learnt there are many senior developers in Replicant that you can pair with to not only solidify your knowledge but to understand the concepts that you’ve just obtained. 
		
		○ The mentoring aspect is not only showcased within the crew but they have also expanded into mentoring developers through their workshops for the Jupiter Platform. At the end of these workshops they asked for feedback so they could keep on improving. Which to me really showcases their eagerness to keep on learning and improving themselves. 

	- Lastly, I think its important to understand how Replicant work. 
	- And to put it the simplest way possible "they make the good stuff easy and they make the bad stuff hard". Replicant started off this process by meeting with developers and understanding the pain points of their platform. From there they built a story map of a developers life cycle and after visualizing their process it was evident where their pain points were.
	
	- The replicant team don’t just drive out products that EVERY TEAM MUST USE. But instead they make people understand why the product will benefit them and leave it up to the teams to make the decision afterwards.  Replicant, work on the foundation of empathy, mentoring and a belief in propagating change starting from the developers up. This is why I really want to be apart of this change driver. 

I would like to split my skills into two:

	- Technological Opportunities:
		○ In the replicant crew there is an opportunity to grasp many concepts. But I would like understand how the Replicant team built a custom layer over the networking layer for the Kubernetes platform. Along side that I would also like to understand how they plan support teams that are migrating software across to jupiter. This would not only allow me to understand more about the OSI Layers but also understand how they built Jupiter and going it's really important to know what they have planned for supporting teams who migrating to it. Because I know that would be very useful for my future team back in Auckland. During my time I also had a convo with Ryan and he mainly mentioned the stack and the tools he worked with but I wanted to know how he managed that and he credited the Learning Milestones that JC created for a protégé during their rotation at replicant. He mentioned that it allowed him to not only improve his technological skills but it also allowed him to build confidence in explaining to a senior developer how the concepts work. There is a testimony from Ryan on the Github Link about his growth in replicant and also I've put an example of one learning milestone. 


	- Soft skills:
		○ Building software with empathy is something I really haven't had the chance to be exposed to during my journey at MYOB, solving our problems with empathy it will not only give us a competitive advantage but it would also allow us get to the heart of what's really important and allow us to understand our clients a lot better. Replicant have achieved this with their Jupiter Platform as the were able to drive out their platform by understanding heart of the problem. Empathy driven development can only thrive in a culture that allows it to propel it forward and I think what Replicant is a real testament to what MYOB can achieve if we develop our products with more empathy. EDD is the most important skill to attain in your software career and if I can get the chance to get an exposure to a team that has really achieved amazing things with it, then you beat I'm going to try my best to get there :)


3. What value will that rotation bring back to Auckland?

As I mentioned before going through an experience in the replicant can bring a lot of benefit back to Auckland and one of the many benefits is that I would be able to share some concepts like the Learning Milestones that Replicant use for each Protégé that comes into their crew for rotation. I've assumed/ drafted out possible timeline to make the approach a bit more easier. I would like to come back to Auckland and discuss with Mark the pros and cons and if he thinks it’s a great fit for the Proteges transitioning into the crew rotations then I would like to talk to the fma-mentor coaching circle. This would be where I would propose the idea to the mentors and hopefully get one volunteer who would act as our pilot. 

Of course during this iteration we would have to keep on getting on going feedback from the mentor and try fix up the process where ever we can. After that we can go through and increase the mentors from 1 to either 2 or 3. And after we get some feedback for them we would hopefully be able to roll this out to the rest of the mentors in Richmond and in Sydney.
With experience attained and in correlation to what I mentioned before I would always try my best to help/share my passion for dev ops where its applicable. So coming back to Auckland I would like to help my future team member to broaden their skill-set and thus reduce the Practice Explosion we see around the organization currently. Lastly, I would like also try and extend out my experience to not only my team but also the Auckland Office so I would like to achieve this with a Brown Bag on Empathy Driven Development and my varying experience of not being in a Product Team.
	


4. What value will you bring to Melbourne in that rotation?

	- We've had multiple opportunities in Auckland where we have had the chance to expose our knowledge in hackathons and also high school student day trips to the office.
		○ But I've also had a great amount of exposure in co-organizing the nation-wide MYOB IT Challenge, which received a lot of praise from Trevor last year and he wishes to bring it Trans-Tasman this year or have a similar event in Australia. If I were to come to Melb, I would be more than happy to share my experience also help run a similar event on deck. I've already spoken to Shailan at the start of this year about trying to create some sort of template guide for future Coding/ IT Challenges to come as it would make our systems a bit neater and keep that consistency across the board.
